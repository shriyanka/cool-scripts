# Cool-Sripts
Some creative, cool and interesting scripts.
Feel free to contribute, re-write, or do whatsoever you want. Every script is Open Source

# Why This ?
Reason-1

In my spare time I just love to script ( Will try to raise the scripting bar :P )

Reason-2

These scripts are mainly to explore and get hand on using various Python-APIs and to automate day to day tasks/work that we do by other means. Its just to show how Awesome our Python is.

# Integrations
Want some help in integrations or see how to actually use the api's?? Hover through above scripts you will find some cool new integrations and demo to how to use it. You will find the corresponding libs --if available-- in libs/ folder above.

# Cool Blog Stuff ?
If you are looking for some cool Blog Posts around Python to plug and play for; then find the links in Blog.txt file above. Although those are not mine :D

# Warning
There might exist some possibilities that my code will require some changes according to your system requirements or configuration to work on your upfront. Please change that accordingly and if you can create a general code that serves everyone, please do create a PR. Thanks :)
