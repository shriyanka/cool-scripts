# Cool-Sripts
Some creative, cool and interesting scripts.
Feel free to contribute, re-write, or do whatsoever you want. Every script is Open Source

# Why This ?
Reason-1

In my spare time I just love to script ( Will try to raise the scripting bar :P )

Reason-2

These scripts are mainly to explore and get hand on using various Python-APIs and to automate day to day tasks/work that we do by other means. It just to show how Awesome our Python is

# Warning
There might exist some possibilities that my code will require some changes according to your system requirements or configuration to work on your upfront. Please change that accordingly and if you can create a general code that serves everyone, please do create a PR. Thanks :)
